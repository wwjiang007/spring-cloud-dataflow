In this section you will learn all about the Spring Cloud Data Flow REST API.
--

[[api-guide-overview]]
== Overview

Spring Cloud Data Flow provides a  REST API allowing you to access all aspects of
the server. In fact the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell is a first-class consumer of
that API.

TIP: If you plan on using the REST API using Java, please also consider using the
provided Java client (DataflowTemplate) that uses the REST API internally.

[[api-guide-overview-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP verbs

Spring Cloud Data Flow tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates. Also used for
resources that imply the concept of `restarts` such as Tasks.

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[api-guide-overview-http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP status codes

RESTful note tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's `Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `409 Conflict`
| The requested resource already exists, e.g. the task already exists or the stream
was already being deployed

| `422 Unprocessable Entity`
| Returned in cases the Job Execution cannot be stopped or restarted

[[api-guide-overview-headers]]
=== Headers

Every response has the following header(s):

[[api-guide-overview-errors]]
=== Errors

include::{snippets}/api-documentation/errors/response-fields.adoc[]

[[api-guide-overview-hypermedia]]
=== Hypermedia

Spring Cloud Data Flow uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources
in their responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application from resource to resource Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate.

[[api-guide-resources]]
== Resources

[[api-guide-resources-index]]
=== Index

The index provides the entry point into Spring Cloud Data Flow's REST API.

[[api-guide-resources-index-access]]
==== Accessing the index

A `GET` request is used to access the index

===== Example "stream deploy" request for a `ticktock` stream

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:9393/streams/deployments/ticktock
----

[[api-guide-resources-index-links]]
===== Links

The main element of the index are the links as they allow you to traverse the API
and execute the desired functionality:

=== Server Meta Information

A `GET` request will return meta information for Spring Cloud Data Flow. This includes:

* Runtime Environment Information
* Information regarding which features are enabled
* Dependency information of Spring Cloud Data Flow Server
* Security information
